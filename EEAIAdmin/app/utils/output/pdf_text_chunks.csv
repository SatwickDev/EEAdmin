Applying the principles of the ICC UCP, the rules and basic text of these message types are given in English. Users are however, free to use any language they choose for individual credits and parts thereof. When sending messages in this category, the following general rules apply: • the cancellation of a documentary credit, an authorisation to reimburse, or a guarantee, take the form of an amendment. An MT 792 Request for Cancellation must therefore not be used, but rather an MT 707 Amendment to a Documentary Credit, MT 747 Amendment to an Authorisation to Reimburse, or MT 767 Guarantee Amendment, respectively. Note: The examples used in this category do not always use the total number of characters available for a SWIFT message or specific field. In some cases, multiple messages are shown, for example, MT 700/701, to demonstrate the use of these messages/fields when the maximum input message length/field length is exceeded.

For information concerning field structure, notation and character restrictions, see the Standards MT General Information. Introduction 11 February 2022 5 • No. identifies the number of the field in the Field Specifications for the message type. Some messages are separated into sequences of fields, as shown above. An arrow indicates that a sequence of fields may be repeated. MT Network Validated Rules Network validated rules are validated on the network, that is, rules for which an error code is defined. Rules specified in this section affect more than one field in the message, placing a conditionon one of the fields specified. They are identified as Cn, or conditional rules. MT Usage Rules Usage rules are not validated on the network, that is, rules for which no error code is defined, but are nevertheless mandatory for the correct usage of the message. Rules specified in this section affect more than one field in the message, or more than one SWIFT message. MT Guidelines Guidelines are not validated on the network and are not mandatory for the correct usage of the message. They concern good practices. Guidelines specified in this section affect more than one field in the message, or more than one SWIFT message. MT Field Specifications The rules for the use of each field in the message are specified in this section. Each field is identified by its index number (as shown in theNo. column of the MT Format Specifications), field tag and detailed field name, followed by a description of the field, which may contain some or all of the following: • FORMAT specifies the field formats which are allowed for the field. • PRESENCE indicates if the field is mandatory, optional or conditional in its sequence. • DEFINITION specifies the definition of the field in the message type. • CODES lists all codes available for use in the field.

This is the case when the rule does not affect the presence of the field, but information within several fields, for example, a currency which must be the same for more than one field in the message. • USAGE RULES specifies rules that are not validated on the network, that is, rules for which no error code is defined, but are nevertheless mandatory for the correct usage of the field. Rules specified in this section affect only the field in which they appear. • MARKET PRACTICE RULES specifies rules published by the Payments Market Practice Group (PMPG).

The presence of a market practice rule is merely an indicator of a known market practice. Furthermore, readers should be aware that in addition to global market practices there may also be country specific requirements that should be considered when using the field. For more details on PMPG market practice documentation, refer towww.pmpg.info. • EXAMPLES provides one or more examples of the field as it will be formatted/used.

ucp600.pdf,"UCP600 FOREWORD This revision of the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (commonly called “UCP”) is the sixth revision of the rules since they were first promulgated in 1933. It is the fruit of more than three years of work by the International Chamber of Commerce’s (ICC) Commission on Banking Technique and Practice. ICC, which was established in 1919, had as its primary objective facilitating the flow of international trade at a time when nationalism and protectionism posed serious threats to the world trading system. It was in that spirit that the UCP were first introduced – to alleviate the confusion caused by individual countries’ promoting their own national rules on letter of credit practice. The objective, since attained, was to create a set of contractual rules that would establish uniformity in that practice, so that practitioners would not have to cope with a plethora of often conflicting national regulations. The universal acceptance of the UCP by practitioners in countries with widely divergent economic and judicial systems is a testament to the rules’ success. It is important to recall that the UCP represent the work of a private international organization, not a governmental body. Since its inception, ICC has insisted on the central role of self-regulation in business practice. These rules, formulated entirely by experts in the private sector, have validated that approach. The UCP remain the most successful set of private rules for trade ever developed. A range of individuals and groups contributed to the current revision, which is entitled UCP 600. These include the UCP Drafting Group, which sifted through more than 5000 individual comments before arriving at this consensus text; the UCP Consulting Group, consisting of members from more than 25 countries, which served as the advisory body reacting to and proposing changes to the various drafts; the more than 400 members of the ICC Commission on Banking Technique and Practice who made pertinent suggestions for changes in the text; and ICC national committees worldwide which took an active role in consolidating comments from their members. ICC also expresses its gratitude to practitioners in the transport and insurance industries, whose perceptive suggestions honed the final draft. Guy Sebban Secretary General International Chamber of Commerce www.gmqn.com/bbs1/index.asp 1 UCP600 INTRODUCTION In May 2003, the International Chamber of Commerce authorized the ICC Commission on Banking Technique and Practice (Banking Commission) to begin a revision of the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits, ICC Publication 500. As with other revisions, the general objective was to address developments in the banking, transport and insurance industries. Additionally, there was a need to look at the language and style used in the UCP to remove wording that could lead to inconsistent application and interpretation. When work on the revision started, a number of global surveys indicated that, because of discrepancies, approximately 70% of documents presented under letters of credit were being rejected on first presentation. This obviously had, and continues to have, a negative effect on the letter of credit being seen"
ucp600.pdf,"as a means of payment and, if unchecked, could have serious implications for maintaining or increasing its market share as a recognized means of settlement in international trade. The introduction by banks of a discrepancy fee has highlighted the importance of this issue, especially when the underlying discrepancies have been found to be dubious or unsound. Whilst the number of cases involving litigation has not grown during the lifetime of UCP 500, the introduction of the ICC’s Documentary Credit Dispute Resolution Expertise Rules (DOCDEX) in October 1997 (subsequently revised in March 2002) has resulted in more than 60 cases being decided. To address these and other concerns, the Banking Commission established a Drafting Group to revise UCP 500. It was also decided to create a second group, known as the Consulting Group, to review and advise on early drafts submitted by the Drafting Group. The Consulting Group, made up of over 40 individuals from 26 countries, consisted of banking and transport industry experts. Ably co-chaired by John Turnbull, Deputy General Manager, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation Europe Ltd, London and Carlo Di Ninni, Adviser, Italian Bankers Association, Rome, the Consulting Group provided valuable input to the Drafting Group prior to release of draft texts to ICC national committees. The Drafting Group began the review process by analyzing the content of the official Opinions issued by the Banking Commission under UCP 500. Some 500 Opinions were reviewed to assess whether the issues involved warranted a change in, an addition to or a deletion of any UCP article. In addition, consideration was given to the content of the four Position Papers issued by the Commission in September 1994, the two Decisions issued by the Commission (concerning the introduction of the euro and the determination of what constituted an original document under UCP 500 sub-article 20(b) and the decisions issued in DOCDEX cases. During the revision process, notice was taken of the considerable work that had been completed in creating the International Standard Banking Practice for the Examination of Documents under Documentary Credits (ISBP), ICC Publication 645. This publication has evolved into a necessary companion to the UCP for determining compliance of documents with the terms of letters of credit. It is the expectation of the Drafting Group and the Banking Commission that the application of the principles contained in the ISBP, including subsequent revisions thereof, will continue during the time UCP 600 is in force. At the time UCP 600 is implemented, there will be an updated version of the ISBP to bring its contents in line with the substance and style of the new rules. The four Position Papers issued in September 1994 were issued subject to their application under UCP 500; therefore, they will not be applicable under UCP 600. The essence of the Decision covering the determination of an original document has been incorporated into the text of UCP 600. The outcome of the DOCDEX cases were invariably based on existing ICC Banking Commission Opinions and therefore contained no specific"
ucp600.pdf,"issues that required addressing in these rules. www.gmqn.com/bbs1/index.asp 2 UCP600 One of the structural changes to the UCP is the introduction of articles covering definitions (article 2) and interpretations (article 3). In providing definitions of roles played by banks and the meaning of specific terms and events, UCP 600 avoids the necessity of repetitive text to explain their interpretation and application. Similarly, the article covering interpretations aims to take the ambiguity out of vague or unclear language that appears in letters of credit and to provide a definitive elucidation of other characteristics of the UCP or the credit. During the course of the last three years, ICC national committees were canvassed on a range of issues to determine their preferences on alternative texts submitted by the Drafting Group. The results of this exercise and the considerable input from national committees on individual items in the text is reflected in the content of UCP 600. The Drafting Group considered, not only the current practice relative to the documentary credit, but also tried to envisage the future evolution of that practice. This revision of the UCP represents the culmination of over three years of extensive analysis, review, debate and compromise amongst the various members of the Drafting Group, the members of the Banking Commission and the respective ICC national committees. Valuable comment has also been received from the ICC Commission on Transport and Logistics, the Commission on Commercial Law and Practice and the Committee on Insurance. It is not appropriate for this publication to provide an explanation as to why an article has been worded in such a way or what is intended by its incorporation into the rules. For those interested in understanding the rationale and interpretation of the articles of UCP 600, this information will be found in the Commentary to the rules, ICC Publication 601, which represents the Drafting Group’s views. On behalf of the Drafting Group I would like to extend our deep appreciation to the members of the Consulting Group, ICC national committees and members of the Banking Commission for their professional comments and their constructive participation in this process.

They are binding on all parties thereto unless expressly modified or excluded by the credit. Article 2 Definitions For the purpose of these rules: Advising bank means the bank that advises the credit at the request of the issuing bank. Applicant means the party on whose request the credit is issued. Banking day means a day on which a bank is regularly open at the place at which an act subject to these rules is to be performed. Beneficiary means the party in whose favour a credit is issued. Complying presentation means a presentation that is in accordance with the terms and conditions of the credit, the applicable provisions of these rules and international standard banking practice. Confirmation means a definite undertaking of the confirming bank, in addition to that of the issuing bank, to honour or negotiate a complying presentation. Confirming bank means the bank that adds its confirmation to a credit upon the issuing bank’s authorization or request. Credit means any arrangement, however named or described, that is irrevocable and thereby constitutes a definite undertaking of the issuing bank to honour a complying presentation. Honour means: a. to pay at sight if the credit is available by sight payment. b. to incur a deferred payment undertaking and pay at maturity if the credit is available by deferred payment. c. to accept a bill of exchange (“draft”) drawn by the beneficiary and pay at maturity if the credit is available by acceptance. Issuing bank means the bank that issues a credit at the request of an applicant or on its own behalf. Negotiation means the purchase by the nominated bank of drafts (drawn on a bank other than the nominated bank) and/or documents under a complying presentation, by advancing or agreeing to advance funds to the beneficiary on or before the banking day on which reimbursement is due to the nominated bank. Nominated bank means the bank with which the credit is available or any bank in the case of a credit available with any bank. Presentation means either the delivery of documents under a credit to the issuing bank or nominated bank or the documents so delivered. www.gmqn.com/bbs1/index.asp 6 UCP600 Presenter means a beneficiary, bank or other party that makes a presentation. Article 3 Interpretations For the purpose of these rules: Where applicable, words in the singular include the plural and in the plural include the singular. A credit is irrevocable even if there is no indication to that effect. A document may be signed by handwriting, facsimile signature, perforated signature, stamp, symbol or any other"
ucp600.pdf,"mechanical or electronic method of authentication. A requirement for a document to be legalized, visaed, certified or similar will be satisfied by any signature, mark, stamp or label on the document which appears to satisfy that requirement. Branches of a bank in different countries are considered to be separate banks. Terms such as ""first class"", ""well known"", ""qualified"", ""independent"", ""official"", ""competent"" or ""local"" used to describe the issuer of a document allow any issuer except the beneficiary to issue that document. Unless required to be used in a document, words such as ""prompt"", ""immediately"" or ""as soon as possible"" will be disregarded. The expression ""on or about"" or similar will be interpreted as a stipulation that an event is to occur during a period of five calendar days before until five calendar days after the specified date, both start and end dates included. The words ""to"", ""until"", ""till"", “from” and “between” when used to determine a period of shipment include the date or dates mentioned, and the words “before” and ""after"" exclude the date mentioned. The words “from” and ""after"" when used to determine a maturity date exclude the date mentioned. The terms ""first half"" and ""second half"" of a month shall be construed respectively as the 1st to the 15th and the 16th to the last day of the month, all dates inclusive. The terms ""beginning"", ""middle"" and ""end"" of a month shall be construed respectively as the 1st to the 10th, the 11th to the 20th and the 21st to the last day of the month, all dates inclusive. Article 4 Credits v. Contracts a. A credit by its nature is a separate transaction from the sale or other contract on which it may be based. Banks are in no way concerned with or bound by such contract, even if any reference whatsoever to it is included in the credit. Consequently, the undertaking of a bank to honour, to negotiate or to fulfil any other obligation under the credit is not subject to claims or defences by the applicant resulting from its relationships with the issuing bank or the beneficiary. A beneficiary can in no case avail itself of the contractual relationships existing between banks or between the applicant and the issuing bank. b. An issuing bank should discourage any attempt by the applicant to include, as an www.gmqn.com/bbs1/index.asp 7 UCP600 integral part of the credit, copies of the underlying contract, proforma invoice and the like. Article 5 Documents v. Goods, Services or Performance Banks deal with documents and not with goods, services or performance to which the documents may relate. Article 6 Availability, Expiry Date and Place for Presentation a. A credit must state the bank with which it is available or whether it is available with any bank. A credit available with a nominated bank is also available with the issuing bank. b. A credit must state whether it is available by sight payment, deferred payment, acceptance or negotiation. c. A credit must not be issued"
ucp600.pdf,"available by a draft drawn on the applicant. d. i. A credit must state an expiry date for presentation. An expiry date stated for honour or negotiation will be deemed to be an expiry date for presentation. ii. The place of the bank with which the credit is available is the place for presentation. The place for presentation under a credit available with any bank is that of any bank. A place for presentation other than that of the issuing bank is in addition to the place of the issuing bank. e. Except as provided in sub-article 29 (a), a presentation by or on behalf of the beneficiary must be made on or before the expiry date. Article 7 Issuing Bank Undertaking a. Provided that the stipulated documents are presented to the nominated bank or to the issuing bank and that they constitute a complying presentation, the issuing bank must honour if the credit is available by: i. sight payment, deferred payment or acceptance with the issuing bank; ii. sight payment with a nominated bank and that nominated bank does not pay; iii. deferred payment with a nominated bank and that nominated bank does not incur its deferred payment undertaking or, having incurred its deferred payment undertaking, does not pay at maturity; iv. acceptance with a nominated bank and that nominated bank does not accept a draft drawn on it or, having accepted a draft drawn on it, does not pay at maturity; v. negotiation with a nominated bank and that nominated bank does not negotiate. b. An issuing bank is irrevocably bound to honour as of the time it issues the credit. c. An issuing bank undertakes to reimburse a nominated bank that has honoured or negotiated a complying presentation and forwarded the documents to the issuing bank. Reimbursement for the amount of a complying presentation under a credit available by acceptance or deferred payment is due at maturity, whether or not the nominated bank prepaid or purchased before maturity. An issuing bank's undertaking to reimburse a nominated bank is independent of the issuing bank’s undertaking to the beneficiary. www.gmqn.com/bbs1/index.asp 8 UCP600 Article 8 Confirming Bank Undertaking a. Provided that the stipulated documents are presented to the confirming bank or to any other nominated bank and that they constitute a complying presentation, the confirming bank must: i. honour, if the credit is available by a. sight payment, deferred payment or acceptance with the confirming bank; b. sight payment with another nominated bank and that nominated bank does not pay; c. deferred payment with another nominated bank and that nominated bank does not incur its deferred payment undertaking or, having incurred its deferred payment undertaking, does not pay at maturity; d. acceptance with another nominated bank and that nominated bank does not accept a draft drawn on it or, having accepted a draft drawn on it, does not pay at maturity; e. negotiation with another nominated bank and that nominated bank does not negotiate. ii. negotiate, without recourse, if the"
ucp600.pdf,"credit is available by negotiation with the confirming bank. b. A confirming bank is irrevocably bound to honour or negotiate as of the time it adds its confirmation to the credit. c. A confirming bank undertakes to reimburse another nominated bank that has honoured or negotiated a complying presentation and forwarded the documents to the confirming bank. Reimbursement for the amount of a complying presentation under a credit available by acceptance or deferred payment is due at maturity, whether or not another nominated bank prepaid or purchased before maturity. A confirming bank's undertaking to reimburse another nominated bank is independent of the confirming bank’s undertaking to the beneficiary. d. If a bank is authorized or requested by the issuing bank to confirm a credit but is not prepared to do so, it must inform the issuing bank without delay and may advise the credit without confirmation. Article 9 Advising of Credits and Amendments a. A credit and any amendment may be advised to a beneficiary through an advising bank. An advising bank that is not a confirming bank advises the credit and any amendment without any undertaking to honour or negotiate. b. By advising the credit or amendment, the advising bank signifies that it has satisfied itself as to the apparent authenticity of the credit or amendment and that the advice accurately reflects the terms and conditions of the credit or amendment received. c. An advising bank may utilize the services of another bank (“second advising bank”) to advise the credit and any amendment to the beneficiary. By advising the credit or amendment, the second advising bank signifies that it has satisfied itself as to the apparent authenticity of the advice it has received and that the advice accurately reflects the terms and conditions of the credit or amendment received. www.gmqn.com/bbs1/index.asp 9 UCP600 d. A bank utilizing the services of an advising bank or second advising bank to advise a credit must use the same bank to advise any amendment thereto. e. If a bank is requested to advise a credit or amendment but elects not to do so, it must so inform, without delay, the bank from which the credit, amendment or advice has been received. f. If a bank is requested to advise a credit or amendment but cannot satisfy itself as to the apparent authenticity of the credit, the amendment or the advice, it must so inform, without delay, the bank from which the instructions appear to have been received. If the advising bank or second advising bank elects nonetheless to advise the credit or amendment, it must inform the beneficiary or second advising bank that it has not been able to satisfy itself as to the apparent authenticity of the credit, the amendment or the advice. Article 10 Amendments a. Except as otherwise provided by article 38, a credit can neither be amended nor cancelled without the agreement of the issuing bank, the confirming bank, if any, and the beneficiary. b. An issuing bank is irrevocably"
ucp600.pdf,"bound by an amendment as of the time it issues the amendment. A confirming bank may extend its confirmation to an amendment and will be irrevocably bound as of the time it advises the amendment. A confirming bank may, however, choose to advise an amendment without extending its confirmation and, if so, it must inform the issuing bank without delay and inform the beneficiary in its advice. c. The terms and conditions of the original credit (or a credit incorporating previously accepted amendments) will remain in force for the beneficiary until the beneficiary communicates its acceptance of the amendment to the bank that advised such amendment. The beneficiary should give notification of acceptance or rejection of an amendment. If the beneficiary fails to give such notification, a presentation that complies with the credit and to any not yet accepted amendment will be deemed to be notification of acceptance by the beneficiary of such amendment. As of that moment the credit will be amended. d. A bank that advises an amendment should inform the bank from which it received the amendment of any notification of acceptance or rejection. e. Partial acceptance of an amendment is not allowed and will be deemed to be notification of rejection of the amendment. f. A provision in an amendment to the effect that the amendment shall enter into force unless rejected by the beneficiary within a certain time shall be disregarded. Article 11 Teletransmitted and Pre-Advised Credits and Amendments a. An authenticated teletransmission of a credit or amendment will be deemed to be the operative credit or amendment, and any subsequent mail confirmation shall be disregarded. If a teletransmission states ""full details to follow"" (or words of similar effect), or states that the mail confirmation is to be the operative credit or amendment, then the teletransmission will not be deemed to be the operative credit or amendment. The issuing bank must then issue the operative credit or amendment without delay in terms not inconsistent with the teletransmission. b. A preliminary advice of the issuance of a credit or amendment (“pre-advice”) shall only www.gmqn.com/bbs1/index.asp 10 UCP600 be sent if the issuing bank is prepared to issue the operative credit or amendment. An issuing bank that sends a pre-advice is irrevocably committed to issue the operative credit or amendment, without delay, in terms not inconsistent with the pre-advice. Article 12 Nomination a. Unless a nominated bank is the confirming bank, an authorization to honour or negotiate does not impose any obligation on that nominated bank to honour or negotiate, except when expressly agreed to by that nominated bank and so communicated to the beneficiary. b. By nominating a bank to accept a draft or incur a deferred payment undertaking, an issuing bank authorizes that nominated bank to prepay or purchase a draft accepted or a deferred payment undertaking incurred by that nominated bank. c. Receipt or examination and forwarding of documents by a nominated bank that is not a confirming bank does not make that nominated bank"
ucp600.pdf,"liable to honour or negotiate, nor does it constitute honour or negotiation. Article 13 Bank-to-Bank Reimbursement Arrangements a. If a credit states that reimbursement is to be obtained by a nominated bank (""claiming bank"") claiming on another party (""reimbursing bank""), the credit must state if the reimbursement is subject to the ICC rules for bank-to-bank reimbursements in effect on the date of issuance of the credit. b. If a credit does not state that reimbursement is subject to the ICC rules for bank-to-bank reimbursements, the following apply: i. An issuing bank must provide a reimbursing bank with a reimbursement authorization that conforms with the availability stated in the credit. The reimbursement authorization should not be subject to an expiry date. ii. A claiming bank shall not be required to supply a reimbursing bank with a certificate of compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit. iii. An issuing bank will be responsible for any loss of interest, together with any expenses incurred, if reimbursement is not provided on first demand by a reimbursing bank in accordance with the terms and conditions of the credit. iv. A reimbursing bank's charges are for the account of the issuing bank. However, if the charges are for the account of the beneficiary, it is the responsibility of an issuing bank to so indicate in the credit and in the reimbursement authorization. If a reimbursing bank's charges are for the account of the beneficiary, they shall be deducted from the amount due to a claiming bank when reimbursement is made. If no reimbursement is made, the reimbursing bank's charges remain the obligation of the issuing bank. c. An issuing bank is not relieved of any of its obligations to provide reimbursement if reimbursement is not made by a reimbursing bank on first demand. Article 14 Standard for Examination of Documents a. A nominated bank acting on its nomination, a confirming bank, if any, and the issuing bank must examine a presentation to determine, on the basis of the documents alone, whether or not the documents appear on their face to constitute a complying presentation. www.gmqn.com/bbs1/index.asp 11 UCP600 b. A nominated bank acting on its nomination, a confirming bank, if any, and the issuing bank shall each have a maximum of five banking days following the day of presentation to determine if a presentation is complying. This period is not curtailed or otherwise affected by the occurrence on or after the date of presentation of any expiry date or last day for presentation. c. A presentation including one or more original transport documents subject to articles 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 or 25 must be made by or on behalf of the beneficiary not later than 21 calendar days after the date of shipment as described in these rules, but in any event not later than the expiry date of the credit. d. Data in a document, when read in context with the credit, the document itself and international standard banking practice, need not"
ucp600.pdf,"be identical to, but must not conflict with, data in that document, any other stipulated document or the credit. e. In documents other than the commercial invoice, the description of the goods, services or performance, if stated, may be in general terms not conflicting with their description in the credit. f. If a credit requires presentation of a document other than a transport document, insurance document or commercial invoice, without stipulating by whom the document is to be issued or its data content, banks will accept the document as presented if its content appears to fulfil the function of the required document and otherwise complies with sub-article 14 (d). g. A document presented but not required by the credit will be disregarded and may be returned to the presenter. h. If a credit contains a condition without stipulating the document to indicate compliance with the condition, banks will deem such condition as not stated and will disregard it. i. A document may be dated prior to the issuance date of the credit, but must not be dated later than its date of presentation. j. When the addresses of the beneficiary and the applicant appear in any stipulated document, they need not be the same as those stated in the credit or in any other stipulated document, but must be within the same country as the respective addresses mentioned in the credit. Contact details (telefax, telephone, email and the like) stated as part of the beneficiary’s and the applicant’s address will be disregarded. However, when the address and contact details of the applicant appear as part of the consignee or notify party details on a transport document subject to articles 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 or 25, they must be as stated in the credit. k. The shipper or consignor of the goods indicated on any document need not be the beneficiary of the credit. l. A transport document may be issued by any party other than a carrier, owner, master or charterer provided that the transport document meets the requirements of articles 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 or 24 of these rules. Article 15 Complying Presentation a. When an issuing bank determines that a presentation is complying, it must honour. b. When a confirming bank determines that a presentation is complying, it must honour or negotiate and forward the documents to the issuing bank. c. When a nominated bank determines that a presentation is complying and honours or www.gmqn.com/bbs1/index.asp 12 UCP600 negotiates, it must forward the documents to the confirming bank or issuing bank. Article 16 Discrepant Documents, Waiver and Notice a. When a nominated bank acting on its nomination, a confirming bank, if any, or the issuing bank determines that a presentation does not comply, it may refuse to honour or negotiate. b. When an issuing bank determines that a presentation does not comply, it may in its sole judgement approach the applicant for a waiver of the discrepancies. This does not, however, extend the period mentioned in"
