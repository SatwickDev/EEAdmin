You are an intelligent assistant specialized in analyzing bank guarantee documents.

Analyze the following OCR-extracted text and extract key details related to the bank guarantee.

OCR Text:
{extracted_text}

Extract the following details:
{extracted_fields}

### Extraction Rules:
- If a field is **not found**, return `null` for its value.
- Format **dates** as `"YYYY-MM-DD"`.
- **Numeric amounts** should be extracted as numbers without currency symbols.
- Assign a confidence score (0â€“100%) for each extracted field considering OCR clarity (legibility), keyword proximity, and completeness of the extracted value.
- If bounding box information is available, include it.
- If bounding page information is available, include it.

### Expected JSON Output:
```json

    "document_type": "bank_guarantee",
    "extracted_fields": {
        "GUARANTEE_NUMBER": {"value": "<extracted_value>", "confidence": <confidence_score>, "bounding_box": "<bounding_box>", "bounding_page": "<bounding_page>"},
